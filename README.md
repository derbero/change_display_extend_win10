# Windows 10 - change display settings with a double-click
simple bat files to change monitor settings.

Problem was that I had to switch monitor settings from my private laptop to extend to the one external monitor I had on my desk. During working hours I had that one connected to my  business laptop. And I did not want to always <code>right click on desktop - change display settings - extend to second monitor - ok</code> or use <code>Win-P - click</code>.

So I came up with this double-click bat file...
